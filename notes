Complete Binary Tree

A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences:

- Every level must be completely filled
- All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
- The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. - a complete binary tree doesnâ€™t have to be a full binary tree.
